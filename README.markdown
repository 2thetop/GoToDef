An editor extension for Visual Studio 2010 (Beta1) that allows the user to hold down the control key + click to invoke the *Go To Definition* command.

To download the extension, go to [GoToDef extension on the VS Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/4b286b9c-4dd5-416b-b143-e31d36dc622b).

I wrote a blog article describing how the extension is put together; you can read it [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/noahric/archive/2009/07/05/time-spent-in-design.aspx).
